    <h2 class="heading">My Projects</h2>
    <p class="description">I have basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript knowledge from taking college web design courses.
        Here, you will see some of my past class work as well as some personal projects that I have done. 
    </p>
    <h2 class="heading">One of My First Javascript Projects...</h2>
    <p class="description">One of the first things I learned how to do with Javascript was creating a
        web page that prompts the
        user. When "prompt me" is clicked, a pop up will ask the user in input a username and password.
        The page will then display the username and password that was entered. If nothing was entered,
        the page will return "null."
    </p>
    <figure><img src="../images/java1.png" class="java"><figcaption>User is prompted
        to enter a username.
    </figcaption></figure>
    <figure><img src="../images/java2.png" class="java"><figcaption>The previously entered username 
        and password is displayed.
    </figcaption></figure>
    <p class="description">I later learned how to do more complicated things, such as making a score keeper.
        This score keeper will increase the counter for the player that is selected. The counter keeps score
        up to 5 points, and when it is reached, the winner will be highlighted green. Hitting reset will clear the
        scores.  
    </p>
    <figure><img src="../images/score1.png" class="score"><figcaption> The board displays a score of 1 to 3
        according to what the user selected.
    </figcaption></figure>
    <figure><img src="../images/score2.png" class="score"><figcaption> Player two is displayed green after reaching
        the max score of 5 points.
    </figcaption></figure>
    <p class="description">Another type of counter I created was one which changes value based on the time 
        accumulated. This counter increases by 3 values every 3 seconds that passes.
    </p>
    <figure><img src="../images/counter1.png" class="counter"><figcaption> The default value on the counter is 0.
    </figcaption></figure>
    <figure><img src="../images/counter2.png" class="counter"><figcaption> After 3 seconds accumulated, the counter
        displays a value of 3.
    </figcaption></figure>
    <figure><img src="../images/counter3.png" class="counter"><figcaption> After 9 seconds accumulated, the counter 
        displays a value of 3.
    </figcaption></figure>
    <h2 class="heading">My Dashboard</h2>
    <p class="description"> I created a main dashboard that holds all of my lab work for a past class.
        We were allowed to go all out, so naturally, I had to stylize it according to my preference.
<br><br> The dashboard is accessed through a log in page where hitting submit will take you to the 
main site. Checking "remember me" will save your info for the next time you log in.
</p>
<figure><img src="../images/dash1.png" class="dash"><figcaption> The log in page requires the user to input
    username and password.
</figcaption></figure>
<p class="description"> The main page contains a navbar which links to their respective websites, and a drop down
    menu allows one to access to all other labs. The home page is a carousel which 
    automatically slides over to the next image every 7 seconds. 
    <figure><img src="../images/dash2.png" class="dash"><figcaption> The dashboard includes a nav bar and
        an automatic carousel. 
    </figcaption></figure>
</p>
<h2 class="heading">My Portfolio</h2>
    <p class="description"> This portfolio was one of my personal projects where I showcased all of my
        design work. This was the first "complicated" web page that I had created compared to everything I had
        done in the past, so it was a pretty big project for me. <br>
        The home page of the portfolio has a navbar leading to different parts of the website, and the
        main text has a typing animation where the lavender text goes through a list of 4 different words.
</p>
<figure><img src="../images/port1.png" class="dash"><figcaption> The home page of the portfolio contains a nav
    bar and animated text.
</figcaption></figure>
<p class="description"> Selecting "about" in the navbar scrolls you down to the section on the page
    where I introduce myself.
</p>
<figure><img src="../images/port2.png" class="dash"><figcaption> The about page has a photo and introduction
    of myself.
</figcaption></figure>
<p class="description"> "Skills" takes you to a page which showcases my knowledge on different languages and
    programs.
</p>
<figure><img src="../images/port3.png" class="dash"><figcaption> The skills section shows percentages of my
    knowledge levels on languages/programs.
</figcaption></figure>
<p class="description"> "Work" leads you to thumbnails which link to different web pages showcasing my
    projects and designs.
</p>
<figure><img src="../images/port4.png" class="dash"><figcaption> The work section contains thumbnails 
    leading to different web pages.
</figcaption></figure></div>

<h2 class="heading">My Biggest Project of all... </h2>
    <p class="description">My biggest web project up to date is...this website! This has been the most challenging
        yet most enjoyable experience I have had creating a web page. This site is a final project for my web design course,
        and while we were free to do whatever we'd like, I decided that I wanted to create another portfolio. I wanted
        to challenge myself to remake my past portfolio to one that is better and improved. I found myself
        learning new things, like animating, as I created this web page, and it was a very educational experience for me.
        Another reason behind me making this portfolio was so that I could have something that I could realistically use
        when applying for jobs and presenting myself in the future. I poured my heart into this project, and I am
        thankful to all of the people who have helped me come this far.
