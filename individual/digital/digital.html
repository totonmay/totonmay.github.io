    <h2 class="heading">My Artwork</h2>
    <p class="description">I have always had a personal passion for digital illustration. Some of the work shown
        includes logos that I have created, animation, and some art that I do for fun. 
    </p>
    <h2 class="heading">Logo Design</h2>
    <p class="description">I designed my personal business logo to be a simple yet easily identifiable one.
        The M is my first initial (Maya), and the circle that contains it represents my dynamic and creative
        qualities. 
    </p>

    <p class="description">A while back, I decided to do a study by designing logos for a potential ice
        cream business. I started with a rough sketch to get a general idea of what I was going to do,
        then created a colored version.

    <h2 class="heading">Animation</h2>
    <p class="description">I followed some tutorials to learn how to animate using the program 
        <a href="https://krita.org/en/" id="krita">Krita</a>. My first animation was a figure of a horse running.

            I mainly enjoy doing sketches of my favorite characters.

    <h2 class="heading">Art is a Way for Me to Express Myself.</h2>
    <p class="description">I love art because of the freedom it gives you. As long as I have a 
        white canvas in front of me, I see endless possibilities. My dreams, my passions,
        and my ideas can all be expressed through art. Not only that, but art tells a story. It sends 
        a message, and anyone who sees it feels that emotion through the canvas. Art doesn't have
        a language barrier, either, meaning it allows for us to communicate with people across the world.
        Design works in the same way that it can speak to the hearts of people. If done the right way,
        design can help those people reach the hearts of others, too. My dream is to create designs which can 
        help people all across the world connect with each other.
