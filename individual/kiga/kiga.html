    <h2 class="heading">Project Context</h2>
    <p class="description">I created a video game concept in collaboration with Xuan Bui and Dilara Kal for a game design course
        at the University of Washington. Students were to come up with an original game idea that focuses on meaningful
        storytelling and interactivity. Our game, "Kiga," follows the storyline of a teen boy who is struggling with
        depression. Players help him overcome his dark thoughts by making decisions and completing tasks throughout the gameplay.
        The final product we created was a Game Design Document with a detailed look at our game's plot, mechanics, and artstyle, 
        along with a powerpoint presentation showcasing our design to the class. </p>
        <h2 class="heading">Purpose</h2>
        <p class="description">Our game aims to create awareness about mental health and the importance of having these discussions. We wish to send out 
            a message saying that it's okay to not be okay,
            and encourage people to talk to others and seek help when they need it. By playing the game and experiencing the
            protagonist's daily life, players can develop empathy for those in a simliar situation. We hope that the game leads
            to the creation of a supportive and understanding community that promotes mental well-being.
        </p>
<h2 class="heading">Design Process</h2>
<p class="description">My first step was to find a source of inspiration that would
    help me determine my game's style. My main source of inspiration was "OMORI," a top-down pixel game that also focuses on mental health and learning
    to open up to others. I heavily referenced its colorful and cute pixel art style with our own game's appearance.
    I also used it as an example to design our game's controls, dialogue, and overall storytelling. </p>

    <p class="description">I came up with a storyline that follows the perspective of a depressed teen boy who creates 
        a bucket list of activities he would like to do, all of which are meaningful to him. He plans on parting with the 
    world after completing them all, but the player is able to change his fate by helping him make the right decisions 
throughout his daily life over the course of 5 days.<br><br>
The next step was to come up with possible game mechanics. An early idea we had was to create a mini game system for
each bucket list activity. We came up with a "happiness gauge" system where depending on how the player performed,
the gauge would increase or decrease, ultimately determining which ending they get. We wanted the game to be simplistic,
so we decided to have two endings, one where the protagonist decides to live, and one where they decide to die.<br><br>
After presenting this initial concept to our classmates, we received feedback on concerns on whether the mini games could
be played repeatedly, whether there will be a performance aspect to them that determines the increase in your happiness,
and whether there will be a time limit system for each mini game. We decided to clarify that each mini game could 
only be played once. At this point, we were considering having 10 bucket list items, but ended up decreasing it to 5 because
we thought that it would've been too lengthy for such a small game. We also chose to make the mini games completion
based rather than performance based, meaning how the player does will not impact the ending they get, only the
decisions they make would. The decisions would be based on dialogue prompts where the player would try to choose the
correct option. Each option will either increase or decrease the "happiness" accumulated.<br><br>
After determining our main game mechanics, I moved onto working on the character design for our protagonist. I
decided that it would make sense for our protagonist to be a 16 year old boy considering the high mental health issue rates
surrounding that demographic. I enjoy giving my original characters some of my own traits, so I decided to give them 
a Japanese-American background with the name "Aoi" meaning "blue" (since he is feeling "blue".) I made some sketches
of Aoi's possible design.</p>

<p class="description">Our next step was to think of bucket list items and mini games. I wanted the items
    to have meaning to Aoi, such as reliving a childhood memory. We came up with five items: building a sand castle,
writing a letter to an old friend, cooking spaghetti, feeding stray cats, and having a photoshoot. Each event
has some sort of significance to Aoi's life and is showcased to the player through visuals and dialogue, making
the gameplay immersive and meaningful. We decided that the mini games should be inuitive and extremely simple,
only requiring basic controls using WASD keys to move around and E to interact. This would mean that players possessing
different skill levels can focus on the gaming experience rather than clearing the mini game itself, and it would
allow them to progress the story with ease. We also decided to include a feature where a flower in Aoi's bedroom
would represent his mental state based on how the choices the player made each day. The flower will look healthy
when Aoi's happiness is improving and appear wilted when it is deteriorating. Players will start each day in Aoi's
bedroom, so they will be able to see this change.

<p class="description">Our game was nameless up to this point, so I decided to give it a name that represents the message
    of our game. I named it "Kiga" which is taken from the japanese concept meaning "reason to live" since 
    it is the player's goal to help Aoi find his ikigai again. Once we decided on a name, I started working on our logo.
I chose a unique, retro font including a visual of the flower for a fitting logo for our game.</p>

<h2 class="heading">Final Mockups</h2>
<p class="description">The last step was to create mockups for our game. I learned how to do pixel art using the art program
Krita by watching tutorials and drew the mock ups in a top down pixel game style. We showcased these mockups in our final
presentation and final Game Design Document.

        <h2 class="heading">Reflection</h2>
        <p class="description">I had never partaken in game design until this course, and I am pleased to say that
            it was a very fun and rewarding experience. I really
            enjoyed leading this project and being able to bring my ideas to life. I am satisfied with the logos and
            mockups I created for our final presentation, and I think that it made me an overall stronger visual
            designer. I also learned how to reference other art styles and draw pieces inspired by them, making me a better learner. 
            Moving forward, I would love to possibly create a programmed game that goes beyond mockups and
            sends out a message to its players.
