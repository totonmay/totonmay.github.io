    <h2 class="heading">Project Context</h2>
    <p class="description">I had the opportunity to work with Christian Perez, Salwa Tecleab, and Dee Yeshitla in an
        Interactive Media Design course. We were challenged to create a design which would improve
        Earth-Mars communication. The design process concluded
        with a demo of a high fidelity prototype for our application.
    </p>
    <h2 class="heading">Design Question</h2>
    <p class="description">We decided to design an application which analyzes rock samples on Mars and sends the data
        to Earth. </p>
        <p class="bracket">┌</p> 
        <p class="question">"What kind of interface would support our user's tasks?"</p>
        <p class="bracket" id="right">┘</p>
        <p class="description">Our first step was to identify our user's tasks and goals.
        To do this, we did research on previous Mars missions, the daily activities of the astronauts,
        and the existing situational/environmental limitations. </p>
    <h2 class="heading">Proto-personas</h2>
    <p class="description">To better understand our users, we identified our primary and secondary
        users and created proto-personas for each individual. Our first user is Sandy,
        a geologist sent to Mars on a mission to collect and send geographic data. Our second user
        is George (mission control) and he will be on the receiving end of the data.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="background">
    <div class="images">
        <img src="../images/person1.png" class="column" id="person1">
        <img src="../images/person2.png" class="column" id="person2">
    </div>   </div>
    <div class="content">
    <p class="description"> Based on our previous research, 
        we came up with qualifications and traits for each individual. Using this information, we 
        noted the needs and goals of our users in order to come up with user task flows.   
    </p> 
    <h2 class="heading">User Task Flows</h2>
    <p class="description">We created flow charts for our user tasks by breaking down the steps that
        they would go through when using our application. The flow chart starts with the opening
        of the app, then prompts the user the mark the location where the rock sample was found. After
        confirming, the device will analyze the sample and allow the user to save the data when done.
        Finally, the user can close the app to finish the process.</p>
        <img src="../images/wiree1.png" id="wire">
    <h2 class="heading">Wireframing</h2>
    <p class="description">Using our user task flow as a base, we sketched out wireframes 
        for the application as the user navigates through the steps. Prompts 
        such as "save location" will pop up when the app is activated, will a simple yes or no option.
         After each step, messages will be displayed to ensure the user
        that their task has successfully been completed, such as "location saved" or "file saved." 
    </p>
        
        <img src="../images/wireframe2.png" id="wireframe">
        <p class="description">We kept in mind ease of use and clarity for each of the 
            frames, removing uneccessary buttons and menus that could cause confusion. We also made sure
            to include important components such as back buttons for each screen so that the user can
            navigate back and forth between frames.
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading">Usability Tests</h2>
        <p class="description">We used the <a href="https://marvelapp.com/">Marvel App</a> to conduct a usability test of our low
        fidelity prototype. To do this, we assigned moderator and note taker roles between the members
    of our group, swapping roles for each test. </p>
