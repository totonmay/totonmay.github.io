    <h2 class="heading">Project Context</h2>
    <p class="description">I had the opportunity to work with Christian Perez, Salwa Tecleab, and Dee Yeshitla in an
        Interactive Media Design course. We were challenged to create a design which would improve
        Earth-Mars communication. The design process concluded
        with a demo of a high fidelity prototype for our application.
    </p>
    <h2 class="heading">Design Question</h2>
    <p class="description">We decided to design an application which analyzes rock samples on Mars and sends the data
        to Earth. </p>
        <p class="bracket">┌</p> 
        <p class="question">"What kind of interface would support our user's tasks?"</p>
        <p class="bracket" id="right">┘</p>
        <p class="description">Our first step was to identify our user's tasks and goals.
        To do this, we did research on previous Mars missions, the daily activities of the astronauts,
        and the existing situational/environmental limitations. </p>
    <h2 class="heading">Proto-personas</h2>
    <p class="description">To better understand our users, we identified our primary and secondary
        users and created proto-personas for each individual. Our first user is Sandy,
        a geologist sent to Mars on a mission to collect and send geographic data. Our second user
        is George (mission control) and he will be on the receiving end of the data.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="background">
    <div class="images">
        <img src="../images/person1.png" class="column" id="person1">
        <img src="../images/person2.png" class="column" id="person2">
    </div>   </div>
    <div class="content">
    <p class="description"> Based on our previous research, 
        we came up with qualifications and traits for each individual. Using this information, we 
        noted the needs and goals of our users in order to come up with user task flows.   
    </p> 
    <h2 class="heading">User Task Flows</h2>
    <p class="description">We created flow charts for our user tasks by breaking down the steps that
        they would go through when using our application. The flow chart starts with the opening
        of the app, then prompts the user the mark the location where the rock sample was found. After
        confirming, the device will analyze the sample and allow the user to save the data when done.
        Finally, the user can close the app to finish the process.</p>
        <img src="../images/wiree1.png" id="wire">
    <h2 class="heading">Wireframing</h2>
    <p class="description">Using our user task flow as a base, we sketched out wireframes 
        for the application as the user navigates through the steps. Prompts 
        such as "save location" will pop up when the app is activated, with a simple yes or no option.
         After each step, messages will be displayed to ensure the user
        that their task has successfully been completed, such as "location saved" or "file saved." 
    </p>
        
        <img src="../images/wireframe2.png" id="wireframe">
        <p class="description">We kept in mind ease of use and clarity for each of the 
            frames, removing uneccessary buttons and menus that could cause confusion. We also made sure
            to include important components such as back buttons for each screen so that the user can
            navigate back and forth between frames.
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading">Usability Tests</h2>
        <p class="description">We used the <a href="https://marvelapp.com/" id="marvel">Marvel App</a> to conduct a usability test for our low
        fidelity prototype. To do this, we assigned moderator and note taker roles between the members
    of our group, swapping roles for each test. We conducted a total of three rounds of testing, having students
from other groups as our testers. For each round, we took note of the participant's name, age, and pronouns. We
had each of them complete three simple tasks using our prototype while asking them to think aloud as they
navigated the app. We took note of how easily they were able to complete the task, as well as whether there was 
any confusion. At the end of the testing, we asked each participant for their thoughts on the app and their feedback
on things that could be improved or changed. </p> 
</div>
<img src="../images/tests.png" id="tests">
<div class="content">
    <p class="description">Based on the user's feedback, our team discussed the changes we could make to 
        improve our design. One change we made was to add the "mark location" option at the end of the process
        rather than at the start, as it makes more sense to do so. Another change we made was removing
        the return button on the "scan results" page since there already existed a "continue" button.
    </p>
    <h2 class="heading">Prototype</h2>
    <p class="description">After making final changes, we created a high-fidelity prototype of the application.
        Figma was used to create the frames. 
    </p>

    <div class="back">
        <div class="frames">

            <img src="../images/frame5.jfif" class="" id="frame5">
            <img src="../images/frame6.jfif" class="" id="frame6">
            <img src="../images/frame7.jfif" class="" id="frame7">

        <h2 class="heading">Reflection</h2>
        <p class="description">The design process allowed me to get a glimpse of what a professional UX designer's
        job looks like. I got the opportunity to collaborate with a team and work together to create
        one final product. It was interesting seeing how our design changed as we went through each step in the process. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Another important concept I learned was the ethics of design and the importance of making sure
        designs are inclusive, honest, and environmentally friendly. One of the things I kept in mind when
        creating our prototype was making sure that the interface is color blind friendly and that the text
        is large enough to read. Moving forward, I will continue to prioritize inclusiveness so that my
        designs may be accessible to everyone.
